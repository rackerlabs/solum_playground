Rackspace<span class="super-script">&reg;</span> Canon is designed to make application development easier and faster. 

The framework provides  <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/app-layout/">Layouts</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ui-components/">UI Components</a> which are combined to form our library of <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/ux-patterns/">UX Patterns</a>.  

These patterns have been designed and tested by Rackspace<span class="super-script">&reg;</span> Product Design.
